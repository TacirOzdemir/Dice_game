Player tries to guess the hidden word.

If a letter is correct but at the wrong spot, the Cow count is increased.

If a letter is correct and at the right spot, the Bull count is increased.

Player wins if the word is guessed correctly.

Player loses if there are no more tries left.

Amount of tries depends on the length of the hidden word.
